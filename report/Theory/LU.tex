\section{Sparse LU Decomposition}

We need to solve equation $A=LU$ where $L$ is the lower triangular matrix and $U$ is the upper triangular matrix. The equation we will get for each element of $L$ and $U$ is given in the following:-
\begin{subequations}
    \centering
    \begin{align}
        U_{(i,j)} & = A_{(i,j)} - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{i-1} L_{(i,k)}U_{(k,j)} \\
        L_{(i,j)} & = \frac{A_{(i,j)} - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{j-1} L_{(i,k)}U_{(k,j)}}{U_{(j,j)}}
    \end{align}
    \label{eqn:LUD:LUequation}
\end{subequations}


We can use Gaussâ€“Jordan elimination to factorize the matrix, although for sparse nature matrix would not be efficient. Therefore we need to go through Direct methods of sparse LU Decomposition. There are majorly three kinds of Direct Methods solving Left-looking, Right-Looking, and Crout \cite{crout}. We will be using Gilbert-Peierls Algorithm: A Column-Oriented LU Factorization with partial pivoting.
